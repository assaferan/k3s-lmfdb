"""
Large-prime regression sweep for hanke_full.maximal_overlattice_2.
Run: sage tests/test_hanke_large_primes.py   (from lattices/)

Not a systematic sweep. The 184-case correctness sweep documented in
install_fast_maximal_overlattice (hanke_full.py) covers rank 3-16, det
1-196, but only SMALL primes -- and it never exercised the bug that was
actually found: find_isotrop_fp used 200 random trials over F_p and
inferred anisotropy from failure, which is fine for small p but silently
wrong over a large one. maximal_overlattice_2(1009*A_2) returned a
non-maximal lattice of det 3*1009^2 (correct answer: 3) with no
exception. find_isotrop_fp is deterministic now, but nothing in the repo
checks that stays true, so this exists to catch it if it regresses.

Oracle: Sage's own IntegralLattice.maximal_overlattice, not the
Genus(rep) == genus check the small-prime sweep used. That check only
exercises representative() end-to-end, calling maximal_overlattice_2
many times per case -- a single bad prime among many can go unnoticed.
Comparing directly against Sage's trusted implementation, one lattice at
a time, is the tighter test for this specific failure mode.

Sage's maximal_overlattice returns the maximal EVEN overlattice (see the
"which notion" note in maximal_overlattice_2's docstring), which is what
we get here too since every case below is run with p=None, the case that
sets did_finish=True and calls finish() to restore evenness. This does
NOT exercise the single-prime p=<prime> path used inside
local_modification -- that path deliberately skips finish() and isn't
comparable to Sage's maximal_overlattice.
