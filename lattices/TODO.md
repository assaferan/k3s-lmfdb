* When Noam responds, tie his code for filling out a genus into ours.
* Go through the schema and make sure that we're computing everything we want to compute
* Write and run tests
* Update front end code to use new data
* Compare with existing (both LMFDB and Nebe-Sloane)
* Compute schema in lat_lattices (in addition to lat_genera)
* Update code to be more resilient to timeouts, and able to parallelize better
